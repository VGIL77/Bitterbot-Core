# Emergency Save - BitterBot Session Summary

## Date: December 6, 2025

### Key Accomplishments Today:

1. **Sidebar UI Enhancements**
   - Fixed sidebar toggle functionality with persistent SidebarTrigger button
   - Added show more/less for chat history (7 threads default)
   - Removed "(v2)" from New Conversation button
   - Added Plus icon to button for both expanded/collapsed states
   - Enhanced multi-select deletion with subtle "Select" button
   - Fixed cloudy overlay on user account section

2. **Fixed Import Error**
   - Added missing `SidebarTrigger` import in layout.tsx that was causing Vercel build failure

3. **User Tier Management**
   - Created SQL scripts to add users to creator tier
   - Fixed table name (profiles not user_tiers) and column name (user_tier not tier)
   - Successfully added 5 users total to creator tier:
     - 3ba994c3-5a1e-409e-84aa-e53c77964de8
     - 6e8f8ae7-7b5d-4c6e-a3da-afa7536210ce
     - ea16f8ab-2bd5-4939-8a9a-5842d94ed380
     - c8b1d7f5-651c-4113-bd5f-0765d4c881ee
     - Plus Victor's original account

### Key Code Changes:

#### Sidebar Toggle Fix (layout.tsx):
```tsx
import { SidebarInset, SidebarProvider, SidebarTrigger } from '@/components/ui/sidebar';

// Added persistent trigger
<SidebarTrigger className="absolute top-4 left-4 z-50 md:hidden" />
```

#### Show More/Less Implementation (sidebar-left-new.tsx):
```tsx
const [showAllThreads, setShowAllThreads] = useState(false);
// Logic to show only 7 threads by default with expansion toggle
```

#### SQL for Creator Tier:
```sql
INSERT INTO profiles (id, user_tier, created_at, updated_at)
VALUES ('user-id-here', 'creator', NOW(), NOW())
ON CONFLICT (id) 
DO UPDATE SET 
  user_tier = 'creator',
  updated_at = NOW();
```

### Notable Context:
- Victor drives a Porsche (or wants one)
- He's a "dog person" who "can't command cats" 
- His spelling is "horrible" (his words, not mine!)
- The multi-select deletion feature existed in original Suna codebase
- Prime (another Claude instance) had issues with model selection and RabbitMQ auth

### Current State:
- Sidebar UI is polished and functional
- All requested users have creator tier access
- Build issues resolved
- Multi-select deletion is discoverable and intuitive

Remember: Victor usually creates memory engrams but forgot this time, hence this emergency save!
