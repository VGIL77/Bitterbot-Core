# BitterBot Unified AGI Platform

A revolutionary integration of distributed AI systems combining Pheromind (AI-powered development), Prime-RL (distributed reinforcement learning), and Protocol-Develop (decentralized infrastructure) into a cohesive artificial general intelligence platform.

## 🚀 Overview

The BitterBot Unified AGI Platform represents a groundbreaking approach to artificial general intelligence, featuring:

- **Distributed Intelligence**: Federated learning and zero-bandwidth training across decentralized nodes
- **Advanced Memory Systems**: Episodic, semantic, and procedural memory with consolidation
- **Dream Engine**: Creative problem-solving through imagination and prompt mutation
- **Emergent Intelligence**: Collective behavior and swarm coordination capabilities
- **AI-Powered Development**: Automated code analysis, planning, and documentation generation

## 🏗️ Architecture

The platform is structured in five interconnected layers:

### Layer 1: Conceptual Layer
- AGI research and theoretical frameworks
- Memory systems (episodic, semantic, procedural)
- Dream engine for creative problem solving
- Emergent intelligence patterns

### Layer 2: Protocol Layer (Rust)
- Distributed task orchestration
- Consensus and validation
- Worker management
- Service discovery

### Layer 3: Intelligence Layer
- Distributed reinforcement learning
- Federated learning coordination
- Multi-agent systems
- Model zoo

### Layer 4: Development Layer
- Codebase analysis
- Plan generation
- PRD creation
- Prompt engineering

### Layer 5: Integration Layer
- Unified API gateway
- Event system
- Data flow management
- Monitoring and metrics
